# Time Series Multivariate and Univariate Local Explanations (TS-MULE)

Repository for the paper "".
It is a general extension of LIME [1] for univariate and multivariate time series.
We therefore extend LIME with a selection of segmentation algorithms for input data.
Further, strategies for the perturbation of the segmented input data is presented.
